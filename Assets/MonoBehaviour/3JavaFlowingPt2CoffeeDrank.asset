  textBody: Fresh with morning jitters, you now crave sugar. Sugar. Must. Have. Sugar.
  options:
  - Eat a donut. Gotta get that morning sugar rush.
  - Jam your face into the box of donuts and consume them all.
  results:
  - You grab a particularly delicious-looking donut covered in chocolate frosting and eat the whole thing in two bites.
  - Physics have no bearing on you as your face phases through the box of donuts as you consume each one with the ferocity of a vacuum cleaner on a dusty floor.
