  textBody: You pull another card. "It's time for lunch," says JOB BOT as a vending machine rolls into view. "At midday, humans would interact with primitive robots known as [VENDING MACHINES] to obtain food." JOB BOT hands you a dollar, which you insert into the machine. Do you buy...
  options:
  - Burrito
  - Candy Bar
  - Pretzel
  - Chips
  - Dig around in the trash can instead.
  results:
  - You obtain a burrito from the vending machine and consume it. Probably would have been better in the microwave.
  - You eat the candy bar, which only furthers your sugar rush from earlier in the day.
  - The pretzel falls down. Undeterred by its lack of any wrapping, you consume it in three bites.
  - You eat the chips, bag and all. This doesn't seem to bother JOB BOT.
  - Digging around in the trash can, you find a bag of chips. Excellent!
