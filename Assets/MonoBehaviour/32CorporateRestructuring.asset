  textBody: Another card, another JOB. Boss Bot wheels a cart over to you with a pile of resumes. "Yeahhh," he drones. "Things aren't going too well. We need to find a couple bots we can let go. Take a look at these employee evaluations." Do you fire...
  options:
  - Safari Bot
  - Fancy Bot
  - Bandit Bot
  - Cowboy Bot
  results:
  - Safari Bot dejectedly levitates by. Safari Bot has seen plenty of sights while out adventuring, but none so sad as the sight of the lobby door.
  - '"First my stapler jams, and now this?" cries Fancy Bot on the way out the door. You eye your stapler lovingly. Your stapler never jams.'
  - '"Aww, it was my first day!" says Bandit Bot, a box full of cheddar in... hand? Bandit Bot seems likely to return to a life of crime.'
  - '"Awwww, I was savin'' up to by a new hard drive!" says Cowboy Bot on the way out.'
