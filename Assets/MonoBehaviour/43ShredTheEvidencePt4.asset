  textBody: You must shred 2 more things.
  options:
  - Shred your magic 8-ball.
  - Shred your I <3 JOB mug.
  - Shred your wall clock.
  - Shred your phone.
  results:
  - Hey magic 8-ball, should I shred you? Ask again later? I don't think so.
  - You know those are limited edition, right? Oh well. It disappears into the shredder's clutches, never to be seen again.
  - Who needs this thing anyway? It's always time for JOB.
  - The phone crunches into pieces in the shredder's teeth, then re-appears in the phone cradle. What is WITH this thing?!
