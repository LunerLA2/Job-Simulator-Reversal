  textBody: A cart containing coffee cups and donuts wheels into your cubicle. "Humans would traditionally start their day with an addictive liquid stimulant," they explain, motioning toward the coffee machine behind you.
  options:
  - Grab a coffee cup, fill it, and toss it back in one gulp.
  - Eat a donut. Gotta get that morning sugar rush.
  - Stick your face under the coffee machine and hit the on button. Cups are for amateurs. You are a professional.
  - Jam your face into the box of donuts and consume them all.
  results:
  - 'You gingerly place a coffee cup under the coffee machine and wait for it to fill before gulping it all down. '
  - You grab a particularly delicious-looking donut covered in chocolate frosting and eat the whole thing in two bites.
  - Sticking your head under the nozzle, you turn on the coffee machine and drink its entire contents. You begin to shake from the caffeine.
  - Physics have no bearing on you as your face phases through the box of donuts as you consume each one with the ferocity of a vacuum cleaner on a dusty floor.
