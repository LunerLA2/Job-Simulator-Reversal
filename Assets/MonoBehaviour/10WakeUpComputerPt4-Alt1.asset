  textBody: Turning back to your computer, you load up the e-mail client per the JOB BOARD's instructions. "E-mail was an inefficient form of communication popularized in the mid-1990's," says JOB BOT, seemingly oblivious that the mid 1990's have not yet occurred. You ignore this glaring logical error as the e-mail screen loads up with thousands - no - tens of thousands of unchecked e-mails. Uh-oh.
  options:
  - Delete all of them. Surely, nothing important is in here.
  - Click an e-mail at random.
  - Do nothing. Hope JOB BOT will give you further instructions.
  results:
  - The screen clears. "Ahh, the freedom of inbox zero," muses JOB BOT.
  - '''how do you type with boxing gloves on?'' reads the e-mail. Your floating hands are certainly gloves, but not of the boxing variety. DELETED.'
  - JOB BOT does not give you further instructions.
