  textBody: JOB BOT seems delighted at your ingenuity. "The computer is the most important facet of the office, with humans and safety being a close 2nd and third," they explain. \n\n The computer now shows a login screen and asks for your password. Your keyboard only seems to have a 1 and a 0 key on it. Interesting.
  options:
  - Password? No one gave me a password.
  - Attempt to locate the password.
  - Type 101.
  - Mash your face on the keyboard and hit log in.
  results:
  - Perhaps you should look for it. Surely, a note of some kind must be on this desk.
  - 'A sticky note attached to your monitor reads ''Password: 010.'''
  - Nice try, dodongo. Maybe in 68 years.
  - The computer unlocks and pops you onto the desktop. Weird.
