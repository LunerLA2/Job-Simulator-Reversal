  textBody: '"Now that you''re the boss of this department, I''ll leave it to you to do the honors," says CEO bot. A large lever with a big red knob on the end floats over to your cubicle. It is currently set in the up position labeled ''WORK HARD.'' The down position says ''GO HOME.'''
  options:
  - Ceremoniously throw the lever. It's the weekend, baby!
  - Sigh and pull the lever. Whatever, they've earned it.
  - Laugh maniacally. Apparently they've forgotten about INFINITE OVERTIME! Now we job FOREVER!
  results:
  - An airhorn blares and confetti streams from the ceiling. "WOOHOO!" shouts a bot. "IT'S TIME TO GO HOME! GREAT JOB EVERYONE! LET'S GET OUTTA HERE BEFORE BOSS TRIES TO STOP US!" Bots cheer and whoop as they make their way to the door, excited for the weekend. Job Bot floats over to you, seemingly pleased. "Well, there you have it human," says JOB BOT. "I hope this has given you a better idea of what it was once like to [OFFICE WORKER]."

  - The lights in the office shut off. Darkness and despair fall over as the clock strikes 5pm. The night shift has begun. You know only JOB. There is only JOB. There has only ever been JOB. And now you are in control.
