  textBody: You pull another card. "Hey co-worker!" shouts a bot in an adjacent cubicle. "Get on your computer and check out these hilarious pictures!" A notification pops up on your computer that you have new e-mail.
  options:
  - Tell your co-worker these are hilarious.
  - Sarcastically tell your co-worker these are hilarious, and delete them.
  - Inform your co-worker that you both live in a text adventure and you cannot fully comprehend memes through this medium due to their inherently visual nature.
  results:
  - Your co-worker looks pleased as you flip through the memes, and a smile lights up your face. You've seen better, but they're amusing.
  - Your co-worker has linked you memes that you saw on JobImg three days ago. You half-heartedly pretend youâ€™re looking at them for the first time. Deleted.
  - '"Wow, I bet you''re a lot of fun at parties," smarms your co-worker.'
