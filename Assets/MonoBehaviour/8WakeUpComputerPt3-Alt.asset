  textBody: As your computer loads the desktop, your notice the phone -- a classic, gray, wired handset -- begins to ring. Much like your keyboard it has only a 1 and 0 button. You pick it up. "Hello, can you connect me to line 1 please?"
  options:
  - Hit 0.
  - Hit 1.
  - Hang up.
  - Throw the phone.
  results:
  - '"Should I just call back later, or...?" asks the voice. You hang up. No longer your problem.'
  - '"Thank you very much," says the bored voice on the phone. You hang up.'
  - You hang up the phone. If it was important, they'll call back. Probably.
  - '"Hey, that was a pretty nice throw!" shouts a bot in the adjacent cubicle. Your phone inexplicably re-appears in its cradle.'
