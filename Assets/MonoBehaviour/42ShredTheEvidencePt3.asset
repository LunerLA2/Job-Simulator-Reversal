  textBody: You must shred 3 more things.
  options:
  - Shred your phone.
  - Shred a paper airplane.
  - Shred your cactus.
  - Shred the Newton's Cradle.
  results:
  - The phone crunches into pieces in the shredder's teeth, then re-appears in the phone cradle. Uhh...
  - With a perfect throw, you send the plane soaring directly into the horrifying maw of the shredder. Nice.
  - Apparently you can't be bothered to water something once a month.
  - Finally, the clicking noise you've been hearing all day ceases. Who keeps buying these things for an office?
