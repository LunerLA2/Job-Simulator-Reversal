  textBody: You must shred 1 more thing.
  options:
  - Shred your phone.
  - Shred BOSS BOT's glasses.
  - Shred the weird pink glob of gum(?) under your desk.
  - Shred your stapler.
  results:
  - The phone is finally silenced. Defeated at last, i- OH NO IT'S BACK. THE PHONE IS BACK HOW IS IT DOING THAT?! WE CAN ALL AGREE THIS IS MESSED UP, RIGHT?!? You turn off the shredder. "Whew," says BOSS BOT. "That was a close one! All right. Carry on. Nothing to see here." BOSS BOT hurries off as POLICE BOT walks in. "Hold it right there! Don't let that bot get away!" He chases after BOSS BOT.
  - BOSS BOT seems mostly unfazed. Did those even have lenses in them? You turn off the shredder. "Whew," says BOSS BOT. "That was a close one! All right. Carry on. Nothing to see here." BOSS BOT hurries off as POLICE BOT walks in. "Hold it right there! Don't let that bot get away!" He chases after BOSS BOT.
  - The shredder handles the gooey mass with ease, though you can't help but wonder what that even was. You turn off the shredder. "Whew," says BOSS BOT. "That was a close one! All right. Carry on. Nothing to see here." BOSS BOT hurries off as POLICE BOT walks in. "Hold it right there! Don't let that bot get away!" He chases after BOSS BOT.
  - Your prized stapler goes into the shredder and disappears into the abyss. A single tear makes its way down your face. Goodnight, sweet prince. You turn off the shredder. "Whew," says BOSS BOT. "That was a close one! All right. Carry on. Nothing to see here." BOSS BOT hurries off as POLICE BOT walks in. "Hold it right there! Don't let that bot get away!" He chases after BOSS BOT.
